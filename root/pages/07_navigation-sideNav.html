            <h2>Date</h2>
            <p>No particular historical date played a role in the selection of the date. Rather, he was a compromise of the desire to make this memorial day as soon as possible after the death of Douglas Adams, and the need to have enough lead-time to get the news around the world. 25th May has since established itself as a memorial day. Other dates that are important to Douglas Adams are February 11 (the 42nd day of the year), his birthday (March 11) and his death (May 11). These were discussed for 2002 as new dates of the Towel Day, but not accepted.</p>
